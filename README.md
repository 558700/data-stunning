# Stunning

Stunningly beautiful photos and images from around the wed.

## Description

For over a decade I have been collecting beautiful pictures to use as my wallpaper on my computer. I decided to migrate the photos and images to this repository to make it easier to work with and share.

## How to Use

If you do not have a copy of [git](https://git-scm.com/), [download it and install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Type the following command into a command prompt:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/grantcarthew/data-stunning

```

__WARNING: This is a large repository. Expect it to take a while to clone.__

This will create a directory called `data-stunning` on your computer.

Once you have a copy of this repository, use it anyway you want. I point my screensaver or wallpaper configuration at the desired directory using a `slideshow` mode.

## Image Sources

A majority of the images come from [Wikipedia Featured pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_pictures). Although a large amount of the featured images on Wikipedia are stunning, not all of them are.

Other image sources will be added as time goes by. The biggest restriction on adding images is the requirement on an open license. I see a lot of amazing pictures on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pictures/) however they are not licensed or are small sizes.

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/grantcarthew/data-stunning/issues) if you know of another source of stunning images that have an open license.
